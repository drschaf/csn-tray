csn-tray
========

Tray Icon that warns you if you reach a specified threshold of your CSN quota.
Hacked together in C. Icons were exported to XPM via GIMP, god bless GIMP. And
thanks to @LittleFox96 for helping out with cmake.

Uses cmake because cmake's Makefile makes a fancy make. To compile type:

$ cmake .
$ make

Have fun. Please fork and improve, I have actually no clue what I did here.

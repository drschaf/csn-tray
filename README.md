========

Tray Icon that warns you if you reach a specified threshold of your CSN quota.
Hacked together in C. Icons were exported to XPM via GIMP, god bless GIMP. And
thank to LittleFox for helping out with cmake.

Uses cmake because cmake's Makefile makes a fancy make. To compile type:

cmake .
make

Have fun. Please fork and improve, I have actually no clue what I did here.
